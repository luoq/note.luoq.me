# Install on gentoo

The install of torch7 on gentoo is quite buggy in gentoo.

**NOTE:**(@ Mon Jun 16 23:08:44 CST 2014)

* install media-gfx/graphicsmagick with use flag png for gfx.js
* install luajit luarocks
* run luarocks as root or some bag things will happen( I forgot exactly what)
* install lua packages listed in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-luajit+torch]()
* 'th' script in 'trepl' is not correctly installed( maybe luarocks in gentoo is outdated), fix it manually
* cp .gfx.js/ from /root to $HOME, since I don't use sudo
