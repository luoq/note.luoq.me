# Install on gentoo

The install of torch7 on gentoo is quite buggy in gentoo.

**NOTE:**(@ Mon Jun 16 23:08:44 CST 2014)

* install media-gfx/graphicsmagick with use flag png for gfx.js
* install luajit luarocks
* add rocks_servers for torch7

cat /etc/luarocks/config.lua

```
rocks_trees = {
   home..[[/.luarocks]],
   [[/usr/lib64/lua/luarocks]]
}
rocks_servers =  {   
    "http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/rocks/master/"
}
```

* run luarocks as root or some bag things will happen( I forgot exactly what)
* install lua packages listed in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-luajit+torch]()
* 'th' script in 'trepl' is not correctly installed( maybe luarocks in gentoo is outdated), fix it manually
* cp .gfx.js/ from /root to $HOME, since I don't use sudo
